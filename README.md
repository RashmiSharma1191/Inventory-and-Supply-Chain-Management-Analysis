## 📊 Business Outcomes Achieved
| Business Objective | Key Insight / Actionable Finding | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Improve Fulfillment** | Identified **Clothing** as the category with the highest Lead Time (15.28 days), pointing to a procurement or handling bottleneck. | **Action:** Prioritize a process review for Clothing logistics to reduce lead time, potentially boosting the overall **Order Fulfillment Rate**. |
| **Optimize Working Capital** | Showed **Days Sales of Inventory (DSI)** at 34.83 days. | **Action:** Focus on reducing DSI for low-turnover categories (found in the Inventory Turnover analysis) to free up cash. |
| **Support Expansion Planning** | Confirmed the **East Region** as the primary driver of projected 2024 sales growth. | **Action:** Allocate capital expenditures (CapEx) for **2024 capacity expansion (warehouse space and labor)** primarily in the East region. |
| **Control Costs** | Identified the **North Region** and **Furniture** as the highest contributors to Total Transportation Cost. | **Action:** Launch a project to renegotiate freight costs or explore alternative logistics partners specifically for Furniture shipments in the North region. |
